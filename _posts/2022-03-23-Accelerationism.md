### Accelerationism: Corrosion of Contemporary Societies

From mid 20th century to this day, capitalist growth and technological progression gained an immense measure. The dramatic rise in growth and technology resulted in the birth of a new, living epoch: the Great Acceleration. This era resulted from the global accumulation of knowledge and its newborn technologies. This entity called acceleration, worthy of its name, unleashed itself from any form of control, and it is cruel in its ways of spreading. Acceleration, with its extensions, raised Orwellian fears by disregarding
confidentiality and freedom, and it contributed to the depletion of resources by constantly feeding capitalism with new tools and more greed. It seized the individuals, blurred the line between living and non-living, and harmed the complex human relationships with uncomprehended technologies. It is essential to acknowledge that the results of this uncontrolled progression can be irrevocable. In the era of Great Acceleration, it is essential to contrast progression from acceleration and understand the possible outcomes of this uncontrolled force. Accelerationism and its products offer a dystopian future by providing constant control mechanisms for corporations and governments that create complete disregard for privacy and freedom, initiating the Anthropocene through encouraging overproduction and overconsumption with media manipulation, and rapidly removing the distinctions between the man and the machine that will result in a monotonous future where there is less room for human involvement.
