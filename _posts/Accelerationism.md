### Accelerationism: Corrosion of Contemporary Societies

From mid 20th century to this day, capitalist growth and technological progression gained an immense measure. The dramatic rise in growth and technology resulted in the birth of a new, living epoch: the Great Acceleration. This era resulted from the global
accumulation of knowledge and its newborn technologies. This entity called acceleration, worthy of its name, unleashed itself from any form of control, and it is cruel in its ways of spreading. Acceleration, with its extensions, raised Orwellian fears by disregarding
confidentiality and freedom, and it contributed to the depletion of resources by constantly

feeding capitalism with new tools and more greed. It seized the individuals, blurred the line between living and non-living, and harmed the complex human relationships with uncomprehended technologies. It is essential to acknowledge that the results of this uncontrolled progression can be irrevocable. In the era of Great Acceleration, it is essential to contrast progression from acceleration and understand the possible outcomes of this uncontrolled force. Accelerationism and its products offer a dystopian future by providing
constant control mechanisms for corporations and governments that create complete disregard for privacy and freedom, initiating the Anthropocene through encouraging overproduction and overconsumption with media manipulation, and rapidly removing the distinctions between the man and the machine that will result in a monotonous future where there is less room for human involvement.
Accelerationism promises a dystopian future by providing corporations and governments with continuous control mechanisms that disregard privacy and freedom. As
 
will be established later in the text, accelerationism and capital are closely bonded. An

argument can be made that privacy is a bourgeois concept, and it gained more importance with capital growth. While this is true, arguing that accelerationism is taking away what
capitalism introduced is not a discrepancy because, as Srnicek and Williams recognized, "what capitalist speed deterritorializes with one hand, it reterritorializes with the other" (24). Although privacy is associated with capitalism, it is still an essential part of contemporary man's life. As Srnicek and Williams acknowledged, improvements made possible by
capitalism should not be seen as enemies to be removed but rather tools to be used (26). Although privacy is a bourgeois concept, it is not to be eradicated but kept. However,
accelerationism is destroying the concept of privacy and freedom with its control mechanisms. Control mechanisms involve technological devices and systems that one is
compelled to use. Accelerationism eventually eliminates traditional mechanisms and makes it impossible not to use products of accelerated technology. With every new medium introduced in our lives, we are exposed to new technologies, and we have no control over whether to use them. For example, choosing whether to use the internet or not is not a choice for a student.
Success in school requires a complete disregard for one's privacy and freedom. School

requires students to check e-mails daily, take online quizzes, upload homework online, buy e-books from big publishers, and attend online lectures on platforms that belong to big
corporations. This way, schools force students to hand their data into big corporations' hands and lose their privacy. This convention illuminates how schools control students by making it impossible to choose not to use technology. An argument can be made that people do not have to go to school, and they can choose whether or not they want to use these technologies. In reality, in control societies, individuals have no control over whether to go to school or not. Because not going to school essentially means unemployment, low wages, and low-quality, possibly unhealthy living conditions. Deleuze suggests that a school is a persistent form of
 
control (7). Indeed, schools had control techniques before, but their control over students is more robust with technological control mechanisms. Deleuze also suggests that perpetual training is replacing the school (5). In perpetual training, a person's devotion never stops; thus, the process of control is permanent even after the education seemingly ends. In light of these, it is safe to say that accelerationism and its products provide more control to those
already in power. The power of the new world is knowledge, and knowledge is data. The more data, the easier it is to develop control mechanisms and manipulate society. As Deleuze argues, "The focus ceases to be the atomized individual, but rather a numerically based
assessment of the dividual" (qtd. in Gardiner 10). In control societies, the focus is never the individual itself, but rather the accumulated statistics, the data. Gardiner concludes that
control is now exercised via countless electronic prints rather than a top-down hierarchy (10). The more data corporations and governments collect, the stronger they are and the weaker the individual. This ties to Marx's argument, the more worker produces, the more control the
factory has over them (29). Having acknowledged that data is the new form of power and

control, its dangers become clearer. The result will be an arms race between corporations and governments to collect data. The greed to have more control will lead to stronger
acceleration, and the stronger acceleration will result in more greed. They will follow individuals, disregard their privacy, and steal their freedom of choice. In essence,
accelerationism's products provide a great source of control for those already in control, and they restrict the freedom and the privacy of individuals. The race to have more control over society will result in conflicts in the future between governments and corporations, and the result will not be in favor of society.
Accelerationism offers a dystopian future by initiating the Anthropocene epoch by encouraging overproduction and overconsumption with media manipulation. Anthropocene
describes the recent period in Earth's history when human activity significantly impacted the
 
planet's ecosystem and natural sources. Understanding how accelerationism correlates with capitalism is vital to acknowledge acceleration's contributions to Anthropocene. Syrnick and
Williams, left-wing accelerationists, argue that "If any system has been associated with ideas of acceleration, it is capitalism. The essential metabolism of capitalism demands economic growth, with competition between individual capitalist entities setting in motion increasing technological developments" (24). Nick Land, another accelerationist, also argues, "Capital, in its ultimate self-definition, is nothing beside the abstract accelerative social factor" (4).
Automation, a product of accelerationism, provides corporations with a more efficient and cheaper way of production for capital. Moreover, increased media control, another
acceleration product, makes it easier to advertise these products and profit from them. So, it is safe to say that accelerationism is both a product and a tool for capitalism.
Having understood the relationship between capitalism and accelerationism, the

consequences of acceleration become clearer. Accelerationism is one of the vital points in resource depletion, as it feeds capital while rapidly consuming natural resources. Albritton Jonsson emphasizes that the ability of humankind to make huge geological impacts has
reached an unheard-of magnitude and measure in the last few decades (55). Although Jonsson attributes this ability that resulted from technological developments to humankind, there are opposers to this idea. Malm and Hornborg, historians of capitalism, attribute this ability to
capitalism itself, and they prefer the term Capitolocene instead of Anthropocene (in Jonsson 58). However, their point is the same: accelerationism and its products provide "too much power" to specific groups. According to Curtzen's research in 2002, only 25 percent of the world population was responsible for the disruption of the environment (in Jonsson 58).
These groups can produce more than they can sell, they overproduce, and thus, they have to encourage overconsumption. Having mentioned corporations' control over individuals, grasping their methodology for encouraging overconsumption is easier: Developing new,
 
uncomprehended, and well-advertised technologies and eventually leaving the individual no chance but to use them. As Syrnick and Williams also recognized, these processes lead to depletion of resources and, thus, to new crises (23). In essence, accelerationism triggers the Anthropocene by serving capitalism, contributing to the awaiting resource shortage.
Accelerationism proposes a dystopian future by removing the distinctions between the man and the machine, resulting in a monotonous future with less human involvement. In the Great Acceleration and Anthropocene era, it is not hard to observe the impact of artificial intelligence and its extensions. As Gardiner recognized, humanity is in the age of
algorithmically modulated bots, machine learning, and computer-generated arts (3). Artificial intelligence, in the 21st century, is seemingly shaping human activities. Artificial intelligence can now do trades, economics, artworks, articles, and other "human products." Although the new, accelerated technologies seem to be suitable for human activities, in most cases, they are not. For example, the economy and the stock market are strongly tied to sociology, psychology, and human emotions. In this case, handing the keys to an emotionless artificial intelligence in a crisis would fail because machines cannot grasp drastic changes in collective human emotions. As an example, Gardiner mentions Cybersyn, the attempt to manage Chilean Economy with computers, ended miserably (1). Nevertheless, accelerationism disregards all the negative aspects of these technologies and forces them into contemporary societies. It regards mimicry of human art as art, imitation of emotions as emotions, and prepares a uniform, robotic future. Besides, replacing humans with robots, which are
essentially made of metals and other expensive resources, will contribute to the ongoing

resource depletion. Their high-level energy consumption will lead to more wars for sources of energy. In essence, letting artificial intelligence and robots rule over the areas where human emotions are deeply related will harm society regarding psychology and management, and replacing machines with humans will lead to more environmental issues.
 
In conclusion, acceleration disregards for privacy and freedom of individuals by providing constant control mechanisms, triggers the growth of the Anthropocene by feeding capitalism with more tools to monetize and overproduce, and it rapidly removes the distinctions between the man and the machine, creating a uniform future where there is little room for human involvement. Thus, acceleration and its products' premise is nothing but a dystopian future. Acceleration will cause energy and resource shortages, and its products will be responsible for the Orwellian future that is being prepared for modern societies.
Humankind should be aware of the upcoming threats of capitalism and accelerationism and

always ask for proper explanations whenever exposed to new, uncomprehended technologies. Acceleration, in nature, is too fast. If humanity does not pay attention to it now, there will be no time to do so in the future.
